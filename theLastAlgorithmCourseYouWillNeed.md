# The Last Algorithm Course You Will Need
## Basics
### Big O notation
- shows growth rate of algorithm as its input does
- 'n' & 'm' are used to denote input size
- constants (coefficient & lower terms) aren't considered
    - the point is to measure growth rate generally
    - if input size doesn't affect the growth rate, remaining constants are reduced to 1
    - constants are important practically
- often the worst case scenario is calculated
### Arrays data structure
- fixed size contiguous block of memory
- segmented by units called elements
- elements are accessed by indices
- assigning elements
    - writing data on bits of their segments
- deleting elements
    - well each lang does it in its own way!
    - usually an special under the hood insertion
- big O of assigning & deleting an element in an array?
    - `read(starting point + index * segment width)`
    - `O(1)`
## Search
### Linear search
- `O(N)`
#### Implementation
```py
def linear_search[T](array: Iterable[T], value: T) -> bool:
    for item in array:
        if item == value:
            return True
    return False
```
### Binary search
- `O(log(n))`
- given array must be sorted
#### Implementation
```py
def binary_search[T: (int, float, str)](array: list[T], value: T) -> bool:
    return (
        False if (length := len(array)) == 0 else
        True if (middle_item := array[(middle_index := length // 2)]) == value else
        binary_search(array[:middle_index], value) if middle_item > value else
        binary_search(array[middle_index + 1:], value)
    )
```
