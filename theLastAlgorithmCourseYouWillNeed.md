# The Last Algorithm Course You Will Need
## Basics
### Big O notation
- shows growth rate of algorithm as its input does
- 'n' & 'm' are used to denote input size
- constants (coefficient & lower terms) aren't considered
    - the point is to measure growth rate generally
    - if input size doesn't affect the growth rate, remaining constants are reduced to 1
    - constants are important practically
- often the worst case scenario is calculated
### Arrays data structure
- fixed size contiguous block of memory
- segmented by units called elements
- elements are accessed by indices
- assigning elements
    - writing data on bits of their segments
- deleting elements
    - well each lang does it in its own way!
    - usually an special under the hood insertion
- big O of assigning & deleting an element in an array?
    - `read(starting point + index * segment width)`
    - O(1)
