# Computer Networking - A top down approach

## Computer networks and the internet

- a route or a path
- ISP
- RFC
- protocols
- primary types of hosts
- access networks
- two primary types of physical media
- packets
- packet switches
- two major types of packet switches
- store and forward transmission method
- the forwarding table
- circuit switching
- multiplexing in circuit switching
- access, regional and tier 1 ISPs
- point of presence (POP)
- multi homing
- peered ISPs
- internet exchange point (IXP)
- content provider networks
- networks structures
- protocol layering
- service model
- the application layer
- the transport layer
- the network layer
- the link layer
- data frame encapsulation
- payload vs header in data frames
- DOS attacks
- three primary types of DOS attacks
- DDOS attacks
- packet sniffing
- IP spoofing

## Application layer

- the level at which applications operate
- client server architecture and datacenters
- P2P architecture
- the shared definition of server and client in the network application architectures
- sockets
- proccess addressing
- dimensions of transport layer protocols
- TCP provided services
- TLS
- things defined by an application layer protocol
- HTTP being an stateless protocol
- persistent and non-persistent connections
- back to back vs parallel TCP connections when using HTTP
- HTTP request structure
- HTTP response structure
- HTTP cookie components
- web cache
- conditional get
- head of line blocking problem
- HTTP/2 framing
- HTTP/2 response prioritizing
- HTTP/2 response dependency
- HTTP/2 server pushing
- components of E-mail
- mail transfer proccess
- mail pulling methods
- DNS
- DNS hirearchy design
- DNS resolve proccess
- DNS load distribution
- TLD name servers
- authoritative name servers
- local name servers
- recursive vs iterative dns queries
- dns caching
- canonical and alias records
- different types of DNS records
- DASH
- CDN
- two CDN major design philosiphies
- collaboration of DNS and CDN

## Transport layer

- transport layer's job
- transport layer mltiplexing and demultiplexing
- TCP vs UDP socket
- principles of a reliable data transfer channel
- MTU and MSS
- sequence numbers for ack and data segments
- random initial sequence numbers
- determination of TCP timeout period
- TCP flow control
- TCP three way handshake
- AIMD algorithm
- QUIC protocol

## Security in computer networks

- aspects of secure communication
- symmetric key encryption
- block ciphers
- public key encryption
- session key
- message authentication code
- digital signature using RSA
- certification authority
- end point authentication
- nonce
- email security
- TLS
