# Learning SQL

## Creating And Populating A Database

- data vs schema statement
- CREATE statement
- ALTER statement
- INSERT statement
- SELECT statement
- WHERE clause
- ORDER BY clause
- DELETE statement
- PRIMARY KEY constraint
- FOREIGN KEY constraint
- CHECK constraint

## Query Primer

- query optimizer
- SELECT clause
- column alias
- DISTINCT keyword
- ALL keyword
- FROM clause
- subquery
- temporary table
- view
- table alias
- WHERE clause
- grouping multiple conditions
- GROUP BY clause
- HAVING clause
- ORDER BY clause
- ASC keyword
- DESC keyword
- LIMIT clause

## Filtering

- usage of logical operators when filtering
- grouping filter conditions by parentheses
- equality & inequality conditions
- range conditions
- BETWEEN operator
- membership conditions
- matching conditions
- wildcards
- LIKE operator
- pattern matching operators
- NULL

## Querying Multiple Tables

- JOIN operation
- cartesian product & CROSS JOIN
- ON subclause
- joining subqueries
- self joins

## Working With Sets

- set theory
- union operation
- intersection operation
- except operation
- pre-conditions of operating on data sets
- compound queries

## Grouping And Aggregates

- granularity
- GROUP BY clause
- aggregate functions
- COUNT function
- using COUNT with asterisk vs column name
- HAVING clause vs WHERE clause
- MAX, MIN, AVG & SUM aggregate function
- single column grouping
- multi-column grouping
- grouping by expression

## Subquerise

- subquery
- single column, multicolumn & scalar subquerise
- correlated vs noncorrelated subquerise
- IN, NOT IN, ANY & ALL operators
- EXISTS operator

## Joins Revisited

- rows returned by INNER JOIN
- OUTER vs INNER JOIN
- LEFT vs RIGHT vs FULL OUTER JOIN
- CROSS JOIN
- NATURAL JOIN

## Transactions

- locking
- read & write locks
- locking strategies
- versioning strategy
- lock granularities
- table, page & row locks
- transactions
- ROLLBACK & COMMIT keywords
- deadlock situations
- alterations within a transaction
- savepoints

## Indexes And Constraints

- table scan
- indexes
- unique index
- multi-column indexes
- btree indexes
- low-cardinality data
- the tradeoff of indexes
- constraints
- orphaned rows
- ON DELETE claues
- ON UPDATE clause
