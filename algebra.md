# Algebra

## Algebra 1 Full Course
### Variables & expressions
#### Variable
- a symbol, generally a letter used to represent an unknown quantity
#### Term
- a single number, variable, or a number times one or many variables
- maybe anything which evaluates to a value?!
#### Coefficient
- a number next to one or more variables
#### Constant
- a plain number which isn't next to a variable, therefor it's value never changes
#### Algebraic expression
- one or more terms separated by + or - symbols
#### Simplification of algebraic expressions
- distributive property
    - multiplication of a factor by an algebraic expression & addition of it's terms are order-independent; both produce the same result
- like terms
    - terms with the same variables raised to the same exponents
    - when combining, addition & subtraction operations are only applied on the coefficients
    - if there isn't any like terms, the given expression can't be simplified by combining terms

### Equations
#### Equation
- an statement claiming that two algebraic (?) expressions are equal
- for an equation to be true, the left & the right side must evaluate to the same value

### Addition property of equality
- the same constant are added to both sides of an equation without changing the final solution
#### Solution to an equation
- any value that makes the equation true when it replaces the associated variable
#### First degree linear equation in single variable 
- the overall form is `ax + b = c` such that `a != 0`
- 'b' & 'c' are constants, 'a' is coefficient & non-zero
#### Additive inverse property
- any number plus it's opposite is equal zero
#### Additive identity property
- any number in addition to zero is equal to itself

### Multiplication property
- both sides of an equation are multiplied by the same non-zero constant without changing the final solution
#### Multiplicative inverse property
- any number times it's reciprocal is equal to 1
#### Multiplicative identity property
- any number times 1 is unchanged

### Solving linear equations in one variable
1. simplify each side as much as possible
2. isolate the variable
3. calculate the value of the variable, plug & check the answer for the equation

### Solving linear equations with fractions or decimals
- multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of all fractions to isolate the variable (must be done after simplification) 
#### Least common multiple 
- the product of the prime factors of the given terms with the most repetition
- the smallest multiple of the given numbers
#### Least common denominator
- LCM of denominators of the given fractions

### Linear equations with no solution or an infinite number of solutions
#### Conditional equation
- an equation that is true for some values as the variable & false for other values
#### Identity equation
- an equation which is always true, no matter what values are substituted as the variable
- usually in this type of equations one side is a simplified version of the other side
#### Contradiction equation
- an equation which doesn't have a solution

### Proportions
- claim that two ratios are equal
#### Cross multiplication property
- states that the product of the numerator of a fraction on one side of an equation & the denominator of the fraction on the other side should equal the product of the denominator of the same side & the numerator of the other side; for example if `a / b == c / d` then `ad == bc`
#### Solving proportion equations
- since in a equation like `a / b = c / d` the LCD of the fractions is 'bd', the shortcut to isolate the variable is cross multiplication of fractions in both sides

### Solving linear algebra inequalities 1
- the procedure is the same as solving linear equations with key differences
    - when using multiplication or division property, negative operand causes the inequality to get reversed
#### Interval notation
- a way of writing subsets of the real number line
- interval notations are used to annotate a range of numbers
    - parentheses mean the end isn't included in the range
    - brackets mean the end is included in the range
    - infinity can never be included

### Linear equations in two variables
- the overall form is `ax + by = c`
- 'c' is constant, 'a' & 'b' can't be zero at the same time
- this type of equation can have infinite combinations of 'x' & 'y' as it's solution
#### Ordered pair
- two terms inside parentheses with 'x' being the first & 'y' being the second
- the two terms are also called components
#### Solving linear equations in two variables
1. pick a value for one of the variables
2. solve for the other one
3. put the solution in the form of an ordered pair

### Plotting ordered pairs
#### Cartesian coordinate system
- has a horizontal number line as 'x' axis & a vertical number line as 'y' axis
- the intersection is called the origin where axes have the value of 0
- it is divided into quadras by counting counter clockwise from the top right quadra
- value signs of ordered pairs for each quadra are respectively like (+, +), (-, +), (-, -), (+, -)

### Graphing linear equations in two variables
- each point in the graph represents one of the infinite solutions of the equation
#### Intercepts
- the intersection of graph & 'y' axis is called y-intercept
- the intersection of graph & 'x' axis is called x-intercept
#### Steps
1. two ordered pairs are acquired, solving for intercepts is usually the fastest way
2. the graph is drawn between & after two points (implied by the ordered pairs)
3. a third ordered pair is acquired to check the graph & the equation
#### Origin crossing graph
- if the value of 'c' is 0, solving for intercepts results in (0, 0)
    1. 'x' & 'y' must be isolated
    2. the resulted equation is solved to get an ordered pair
- picking the coefficient of a variable for as the other is usually faster
#### Special case scenarios
- vertical line
    - has a fixed value for 'x'
    - is parallel to 'y' axis
    - the equation in this scenario has 'b' as zero
- horizontal line
    - has a fixed value for 'y'
    - is parallel to 'x' axis
    - the equation in this scenario has 'a' as zero

### Slope of line
- is measured by comparing vertical to horizontal changes along a line
- the graph is possible to draw given one point & the slope
#### Calculation of slope using given points
1. ordered pairs are labeled as (x1, y1), (x2, y2)
2. the result is calculated by this formula: `m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`
- 'a' can't be zero in the equation & x2 can't be equal to x1 because of division by zero in the formula
- 'm' can be thought of as 'rise' over 'run' & calculated visually (`points towards up / points towards right`)
- a line with positive slope rises moving towards right ('y' increases when 'x' increases)
- a line with negative slope falls moving towards right ('y' decreases when 'x' increases)
- the slope of a horizontal line is 0
- the slope of a vertical line is undefined

### Equations of line
- other than the standard overall form
#### Slope - intercept form
- in this form, the slope & the y-intercept are visible
- when solving the equation for 'y', the overall form will be `y = mx + b`
- 'm' shows the slope & 'b' is the y-intercept which occures at (0, b)
#### Point - slope form
- in this form, the slope & the coordinations of a single point is visible
- the overall form is `m (x - x1) = y - y1` with the given point (x1, y1)
- is possible to derive from three combination of info:
    - `m = (y - y1) / (x - x1)` form
    - a given point & slope (which leads the above option)
    - two given points (which leads the above option)
#### Stupid version of the standard form
- the same, but with 'a' being equal or greater than zero

### Parallel & perpendicular lines
#### Parallel lines
- lines that will never intersect
- non-vertical parallel lines have the same slopes
#### Perpendicular
- lines that intersect at a 90 degree angle
- the product of slopes of two non-vertical perpendicular lines is -1

### Graphing linear inequalities in two variables
#### Steps
1. solve the inequality for 'y'
2. draw the boundary line
    1. replace the inequality symbol with equality symbol
    2. draw the resulted line
3. shade
    - above the line for '>' & '>='
    - below the line for '<' & '<='
#### Special case scenarios
- the shading conditions are different for vertical boundary lines
    - right side of the line for '>' & '>='
    - left side of the line for '<' & '<='

### Introduction to functions
- represents a relation in which each unique first component corresponds to exactyly one non-unique second component
- all functions are relation, but not vice versa
#### Relation
- any set of ordered pairs
#### Domain
- set of all the first components ('x' values) in a relation
#### Range
- set of all the second components ('y' values) in a relation
#### Vertical line test
- if any vertical line intersects a graph more than once, the graph isn't a function (although it may be an equation)

## Algebra 2 Full Course

## Cool facts
- equations in a single variable represent a single point in the line number ('x' axis)
    - therefore graphing ineqalities in a single variable results in a line, cause infinite number of points are concatenated together
- equations in two variables represent a line in the coordinate plane ('x' & 'y' axes)
    - therefore graphing inequalities in two variables results in a shaded area, cause infinite number of lines are concatenated together
- the elimination method to solve systems of linear equations uses the addition property of equality
- `-a^x = -(a^x)` but `(-a)^x = (-a)^x` therefore `(-ab)^x = (-a)^x . b^x`
- if a term is being raised by a power, each factor is raised separatedly
- if a factor of a term is being raised to a power, other components remain the same
- by decreasing the power the value is being devided by the base
- when calculating the GCF of a polynomail, it is a common practice to also factor a -1 when it's terms are mostly negative
