# Algebra

## Algebra 1 Full Course
### Variables & expressions
#### Variable
- a symbol, generally a letter used to represent an unknown quantity
#### Term
- a single number, variable, or a number times one or many variables
- maybe anything which evaluates to a value?!
#### Coefficient
- a number next to one or more variables
#### Constant
- a plain number which isn't next to a variable, therefor it's value never changes
#### Algebraic expression
- one or more terms separated by + or - symbols
#### Simplification of algebraic expressions
- Distributive property
    - makes it possible to distribute a factor (coefficient) to each term of it's expression
#### Like terms
- terms with the exact same variables that have the exact same exponents
- when combining like terms, addition & subtraction operations are only applied on the coefficients
- if there isn't any like terms, the given expression can't be simplified by combining terms

### Equations
#### Equation
- an statement claiming that two algebraic (?) expressions are equal
- for an equation to be true, the left & the right side must evaluate to the same value

### Addition property
- the same constant can be added to both sides of an equation without changing the final solution
#### Solution to an equation
- any value that makes the equation true when it replaces the associated variable
#### Single variable first degree linear equation
- the overall form is `ax + b = c` such that `a != 0`
- in this form 'b' & 'c' are known constants & 'a' is coefficient
#### Additive inverse property
- any number plus it's opposite is equal zero
#### Additive identity property
- any number in addition to zero eqauls itself

### Multiplication property
- both sides of an equation can be multiplied by the same non-zero constant without changing the final solution
#### Multiplicative inverse property
- any number times it's reciprocal is equal to 1
#### Multiplicative identity property
- any number times 1 is unchanged

### Solving linear equations in one variable
1. simplify each side as much as possible
2. isolate the variable
3. calculate the value of the variable, plug & check the answer for the equation

### Solving linear equations with fractions or decimals
- multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of all fractions to isolate the variable (which is the LCM of all denominators) (must be done after simplification) 
#### Least common multiple 
- the smallest number that two or more numbers can divide into evenly
#### Least common denominator
- the smallest number that can be a common denominator for a set of fractions

### Linear equations with no solution or an infinite number of solutions
#### Conditional equation
- an equation that is true for some values as the variable and false for other values
#### Identity equation
- an equation which is always true, no matter what values are substituted as the variable
- usually in this type of equations one side is a simplified version of the other side
#### Contradiction equation
- an equation which doesn't have a solution

### Proportions
- claim that two ratios are equal
#### Cross multiplication property
- states that the product of the numerator of a fraction on one side of an equation and the denominator of the fraction on the other side should equal the product of the denominator of the same side and the numerator of the other side; for example if `a / b == c / d` then `ad == bc`
#### Solving proportion equations
- since in a equation like `a / b = c / d` the LCD of the fractions is 'bd', the shortcut to isolate the variable can be cross multiplication of fractions in both sides

### Solving linear algebra inequalities 1
- the procedure is the same as solving linear equations with key differences
    - when using multiplication property, negative operand causes the inequality to get reversed
#### Interval notation
- a way of writing subsets of the real number line
- interval notations can be used to annotate a range of numbers
    - parentheses mean the end isn't included in the range
    - brackets mean the end is included in the range
    - infinity can never be included
