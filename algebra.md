# Algebra

## Algebra 1 Full Course
### Variables & expressions
#### Variable
- a symbol, generally a letter used to represent an unknown quantity
#### Term
- a single number, variable, or a number times one or many variables
- maybe anything which evaluates to a value?!
#### Coefficient
- a number next to one or more variables
#### Constant
- a plain number which isn't next to a variable, therefor it's value never changes
#### Algebraic expression
- one or more terms separated by + or - symbols
#### Simplification of algebraic expressions
- Distributive property
    - makes it possible to distribute a factor (coefficient) to each term of it's expression
#### Like terms
- terms with the exact same variables that have the exact same exponents
- when combining like terms, addition & subtraction operations are only applied on the coefficients
- if there isn't any like terms, the given expression can't be simplified by combining terms

### Equations
#### Equation
- an statement claiming that two algebraic (?) expressions are equal
- for an equation to be true, the left & the right side must evaluate to the same value

### Addition property
- the same constant are added to both sides of an equation without changing the final solution
#### Solution to an equation
- any value that makes the equation true when it replaces the associated variable
#### Single variable first degree linear equation
- the overall form is `ax + b = c` such that `a != 0`
- 'b' & 'c' are constants, 'a' is coefficient & non-zero
#### Additive inverse property
- any number plus it's opposite is equal zero
#### Additive identity property
- any number in addition to zero is equal to itself

### Multiplication property
- both sides of an equation are multiplied by the same non-zero constant without changing the final solution
#### Multiplicative inverse property
- any number times it's reciprocal is equal to 1
#### Multiplicative identity property
- any number times 1 is unchanged

### Solving linear equations in one variable
1. simplify each side as much as possible
2. isolate the variable
3. calculate the value of the variable, plug & check the answer for the equation

### Solving linear equations with fractions or decimals
- multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of all fractions to isolate the variable (which is the LCM of all denominators) (must be done after simplification) 
#### Least common multiple 
- the smallest number that two or more numbers can divide into evenly
#### Least common denominator
- the smallest number that is a common denominator for a set of fractions

### Linear equations with no solution or an infinite number of solutions
#### Conditional equation
- an equation that is true for some values as the variable & false for other values
#### Identity equation
- an equation which is always true, no matter what values are substituted as the variable
- usually in this type of equations one side is a simplified version of the other side
#### Contradiction equation
- an equation which doesn't have a solution

### Proportions
- claim that two ratios are equal
#### Cross multiplication property
- states that the product of the numerator of a fraction on one side of an equation & the denominator of the fraction on the other side should equal the product of the denominator of the same side & the numerator of the other side; for example if `a / b == c / d` then `ad == bc`
#### Solving proportion equations
- since in a equation like `a / b = c / d` the LCD of the fractions is 'bd', the shortcut to isolate the variable is cross multiplication of fractions in both sides

### Solving linear algebra inequalities 1
- the procedure is the same as solving linear equations with key differences
    - when using multiplication or division property, negative operand causes the inequality to get reversed
#### Interval notation
- a way of writing subsets of the real number line
- interval notations are used to annotate a range of numbers
    - parentheses mean the end isn't included in the range
    - brackets mean the end is included in the range
    - infinity can never be included

### Linear equations in two variables
- the overall form is `ax + by = c`
- 'c' is constant, 'a' & 'b' can't be zero at the same time
- this type of equation can have infinite combinations of 'x' & 'y' as it's solution
#### Ordered pair
- two terms inside parentheses with 'x' being the first & 'y' being the second
- the two terms are also called components
#### Solving linear equations in two variables
1. pick a value for one of the variables
2. solve for the other one
3. put the solution in the form of an ordered pair

### Plotting ordered pairs
#### Cartesian coordinate system
- has a horizontal number line as 'x' axis & a vertical number line as 'y' axis
- the intersection is called the origin where axes have the value of 0
- it is divided into quadras by counting counter clockwise from the top right quadra
- value signs of ordered pairs for each quadra are respectively like (+, +), (-, +), (-, -), (+, -)

### Graphing linear equations in two variables
- each point in the graph represents one of the infinite solutions of the equation
#### Intercepts
- the intersection of graph & 'y' axis is called y-intercept
- the intersection of graph & 'x' axis is called x-intercept
#### Steps
1. two ordered pairs are acquired, solving for intercepts is usually the fastest way
2. the graph is drawn between & after two points (implied by the ordered pairs)
3. a third ordered pair is acquired to check the graph & the equation
#### Origin crossing graph
- if the value of 'c' is 0, solving for intercepts results in (0, 0)
    1. 'x' & 'y' must be isolated
    2. the resulted equation is solved to get an ordered pair
- picking the coefficient of a variable for as the other is usually faster
#### Special case scenarios
- vertical line
    - has a fixed value for 'x'
    - is parallel to 'y' axis
    - the equation in this scenario has 'b' as zero
- horizontal line
    - has a fixed value for 'y'
    - is parallel to 'x' axis
    - the equation in this scenario has 'a' as zero

### Slope of line
- is measured by comparing vertical to horizontal changes along a line
- the graph is possible to draw given one point & the slope
#### Calculation of slope using given points
1. ordered pairs are labeled as (x1, y1), (x2, y2)
2. the result is calculated by this formula: `m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)`
- 'a' can't be zero in the equation & x2 can't be equal to x1 because of division by zero in the formula
- 'm' can be thought of as 'rise' over 'run' & calculated visually (`points towards up / points towards right`)
- a line with positive slope rises moving towards right ('y' increases when 'x' increases)
- a line with negative slope falls moving towards right ('y' decreases when 'x' increases)
- the slope of a horizontal line is 0
- the slope of a vertical line is undefined

### Equations of line
- other than the standard overall form
#### Slope - intercept form
- in this form, the slope & the y-intercept are visible
- when solving the equation for 'y', the overall form will be `y = mx + b`
- 'm' shows the slope & 'b' is the y-intercept which occures at (0, b)
#### Point - slope form
- in this form, the slope & the coordinations of a single point is visible
- the overall form is `m (x - x1) = y - y1` with the given point (x1, y1)
- is possible to derive from three combination of info:
    - `m = (y - y1) / (x - x1)` form
    - a given point & slope (which leads the above option)
    - two given points (which leads the above option)
#### Stupid version of the standard form
- the same, but with 'a' being equal or greater than zero

### Parallel & perpendicular lines
#### Parallel lines
- lines that will never intersect
- non-vertical parallel lines have the same slopes
#### Perpendicular
- lines that intersect at a 90 degree angle
- the product of slopes of two non-vertical perpendicular lines is -1

### Graphing linear inequalities in two variables
#### Steps
1. solve the inequality for 'y'
2. draw the boundary line
    1. replace the inequality symbol with equality symbol
    2. draw the resulted line
3. shade
    - above the line for '>' & '>='
    - below the line for '<' & '<='
#### Special case scenarios
- the shading conditions are different for vertical boundary lines
    - right side of the line for '>' & '>='
    - left side of the line for '<' & '<='

### Introduction to functions
- represents a relation in which each unique first component corresponds to exactyly one non-unique second component
- all functions are relation, but not vice versa
#### Relation
- any set of ordered pairs
#### Domain
- set of all the first components ('x' values) in a relation
#### Range
- set of all the second components ('y' values) in a relation
#### Vertical line test
- if any vertical line intersects a graph more than once, the graph isn't a function (although it may be an equation)

### Solving systems of linear equations by graphing
#### System of linear equations
- consists of multiple linear equations with the same variables
- a solution is an ordered pair that makes all the given equations true
#### Consistent system

#### Inconsistent system
- have parallel equations therefore solutions aren't possible
#### Dependent equations
- are equivalent of each other therefore intersections are infinite
#### Graphing steps
1. each equation is graphed
2. their intersection is the solution
#### Special case scenarios
- parallel equations won't intersect
- equivalent equations result in infinite solutions
    - is detectable by solving for 'y'

5. the resulted equation in a single variable is solved
5. the ordered pair is written based on choices
#### Inconsistent system proof
- when the equality sign is wrong
- given equations have the same slopes & different y-intercepts
#### Dependent equations proof
- when the variables drop out in simplification
- the equations are manipulated versions of each other

### Solving systems of linear equations by elimination
#### Steps
1. equations are written in standard form
2. equations are manipulated such that coefficients of either variables are opposites across them
3. equations are merged (sides are added up)
    - one of the variables is cancelled out
4. the resulted equation in a single variable is solved
5. the result is plugged in an original equation as the known variable
6. the resulted equation in a single variable is solved
7. the ordered pair is written based on choices
#### Detection
- either variables has opposite coefficients in the given equations

### Solving systems of linear inequalities
#### Graphing
1. graph each equation separatedly
2. intersection of the graphs is the solution
- is graphing the only way?

### Product & power rules for exponents
#### Product rule for exponents
- when operands of the same base are multiplied, the exponents are combined to get the result
#### Power to power rule
- when a base being raised to a power is being raised to another power, the two powers are multiplied to get the result
#### Raising product to power
- a term being raised to a power is written as it's divisors being raised to the power
#### Fractional exponent rule
- a fraction being raised to a power is written as it's numerator into the power divided by it's denominator into the power

### Integer exponents & the quotient rule
#### Zero exponent rule
- any non-zero value to the power of zero results in 1
#### Negative exponent rule
- the factor is written as it's reciprocal with the denominator being raised to the opposed exponent
- it's coefficient is written as the numerator of the fraction
#### Algebraic version of the quotient rule
- when operands of the same base are divided, the exponents are subtracted to get the result

### Scientific notation
- represents a number as a factor multiplied by a power of ten

### Adding & subtracting polynomials
#### Polynomial
- a finite amount of terms being the product of a real coefficient & variables raised to a whole power
#### Monomial
- a polynomial consisting of one term
#### Binomial
- a polynomial consisting of two terms
#### Trinomial
- a polynomial consisting of three terms
#### Degree of a term
- sum of the exponents of all the variables of the given term
#### Degree of a polynomial

### Multiplying polynomials
- if neither polynomial is monomial, each term of either polynomial is multiplied by every term in the other one

### FOIL
- is used for two binomials
#### Steps
1. first, outer, inner & last terms of each binomial are multiplied together
2. results are merged

### Special products
- common binomial products
#### Square of a binomial
- first form is `(a + b) ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + 2ab + b ^ 2`
- second form is `(a - b) ^ 2 = a ^ 2 - 2ab + b ^ 2`
#### Difference of squares
- the overall form is `(a + b)(a - b) = a ^ 2 - b ^ 2`
#### Cube of a binomial
- first form is `(a + b) ^ 3 = a ^ 3 + 3ba ^ 2 + 3ab ^ 2 + b ^ 3`
- second form is `(a - b) ^ 3 = a ^ 3 - 3ba ^ 2 + 3ab ^ 2 - b ^ 3`

### Dividing polynomials by monomials

3. the result of the division is added to the quotient as a term
4. the quotient is made sure to be in the standard form
5. the result of the division is multiplied by the divisor
6. the result of the multiplication is subtracted from the dividend
7. the rest of the dividend is appended to the result of the subtraction
8. if dividend is less than divisior & the terms are over, the division is finished
9. the final answer is an algebraic expression having the quotient as it's first term plus a fraction representing the remainder

### Dividing polynomials with missing terms
- meaning that one or more of the exponents of the given variable are missing
#### Resolving by place holders
- missing exponents of the variable is inserted in the polynomial with the coefficient of 0

## Cool facts
- equations in a single variable represent a single point in the line number ('x' axis)
    - therefore graphing ineqalities in a single variable results in a line, cause infinite number of points are concatenated together
- equations in two variables represent a line in the coordinate plane ('x' & 'y' axes)
    - therefore graphing inequalities in two variables results in a shaded area, cause infinite number of lines are concatenated together
- the elimination method to solve systems of linear equations uses the addition property of equality
- `-a ^ x = -(a ^ x)` but `(-a) ^ x = (-a) ^ x` therefore `(-ab) ^ x = (-a) ^ x . b ^ x`
- if a term is being raised by a power, each factor is raised separatedly
- if a factor of a term is being raised to a power, other components remain the same
- by decreasing the power the value is being devided by the base
