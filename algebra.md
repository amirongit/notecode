# Algebra

## Algebra 1 Full Course
### Variables & expressions
#### Variable
- a symbol, generally a letter used to represent an unknown quantity
#### Term
- a single number, variable, or a number times one or many variables
- maybe anything which evaluates to a value?!
#### Coefficient
- a number next to one or more variables
#### Constant
- a plain number which isn't next to a variable, therefor it's value never changes
#### Algebraic expression
- one or more terms separated by + or - symbols
#### Simplification of algebraic expressions
- Distributive property
    - makes it possible to distribute a factor (coefficient) to each term of it's expression
#### Like terms
- terms with the exact same variables that have the exact same exponents
- when combining like terms, addition & subtraction operations are only applied on the coefficients
- if there isn't any like terms, the given expression can't be simplified by combining terms

### Equations
#### Equation
- an statement claiming that two algebraic (?) expressions are equal
- for an equation to be true, the left & the right side must evaluate to the same value

### Addition property of equality
- the same constant can be added to both sides of an equation without changing the final solution
#### Solution to an equation
- any value that makes the equation true when it replaces the associated variable
#### Single variable first degree linear equations
- the overall form is `ax + b = c` such that `a != 0`
- in this form 'b' & 'c' are known constants & 'a' is coefficient
#### Additive inverse property
- any number plus it's opposite is equal zero
#### Additive identity property
- any number in addition to zero eqauls itself

### Multiplication property of equality
- both sides of an equation can be multiplied by the same non-zero constant without changing the final solution
#### Multiplicative inverse property
- any number times it's reciprocal is equal to 1
#### Multiplicative identity property
- any number times 1 is unchanged

### Solving linear equations in one variable
1. simplify each side as much as possible
2. isolate the variable
3. calculate the value of the variable, plug & check the answer for the equation

### Solving linear equations with fractions or decimals
- multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of all fractions to isolate the variable (which is the LCM of all denominators) (must be done after simplification) 
#### Least common multiple 
- the smallest number that two or more numbers can divide into evenly
#### Least common denominator
- the smallest number that can be a common denominator for a set of fractions

### Linear equations with no solution or an infinite number of solutions
#### Conditional equation
- an equation that is true for some values as the variable and false for other values
#### Identity equation
- an equation which is always true, no matter what values are substituted as the variable
- usually in this type of equations one side is a simplified version of the other side
#### Contradiction equation
- an equation which doesn't have a solution
