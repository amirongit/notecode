### Variables & expressions
#### Variable
- a symbol, generally a letter used to represent an unknown quantity
#### Term
- a single number, variable, or a number times one or many variables
- maybe anything which evaluates to a value?!
#### Coefficient
- a number next to one or more variables
#### Constant
- a plain number which isn't next to a variable, therefor it's value never changes
#### Algebric expression
- one or more terms separated by + or - symbols
#### Simplification of algebric expressions
- Distributive property
    - makes it possible to distribute a factor (coefficient) to each term of it's expression
#### Like terms
- terms with the exact same variables that have the exact same exponents
- when combining like terms, addition & subtraction operations are only applied on the coefficients
- if there isn't any like terms, the given expression can't be simplified by combining terms
