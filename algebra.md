# Algebra

## Algebra 1 Full Course
### Variables & expressions
#### Variable
- a symbol, generally a letter used to represent an unknown quantity
#### Term
- a single number, variable, or a number times one or many variables
- maybe anything which evaluates to a value?!
#### Coefficient
- a number next to one or more variables
#### Constant
- a plain number which isn't next to a variable, therefor it's value never changes
#### Algebraic expression
- one or more terms separated by + or - symbols
#### Simplification of algebraic expressions
- Distributive property
    - makes it possible to distribute a factor (coefficient) to each term of it's expression
#### Like terms
- terms with the exact same variables that have the exact same exponents
- when combining like terms, addition & subtraction operations are only applied on the coefficients
- if there isn't any like terms, the given expression can't be simplified by combining terms

### Equations
#### Equation
- an statement claiming that two algebraic (?) expressions are equal
- for an equation to be true, the left & the right side must evaluate to the same value

### Addition property
- the same constant can be added to both sides of an equation without changing the final solution
#### Solution to an equation
- any value that makes the equation true when it replaces the associated variable
#### Single variable first degree linear equation
- the overall form is `ax + b = c` such that `a != 0`
- 'b' & 'c' are constants, 'a' is coefficient & non-zero
#### Additive inverse property
- any number plus it's opposite is equal zero
#### Additive identity property
- any number in addition to zero eqauls itself

### Multiplication property
- both sides of an equation can be multiplied by the same non-zero constant without changing the final solution
#### Multiplicative inverse property
- any number times it's reciprocal is equal to 1
#### Multiplicative identity property
- any number times 1 is unchanged

### Solving linear equations in one variable
1. simplify each side as much as possible
2. isolate the variable
3. calculate the value of the variable, plug & check the answer for the equation

### Solving linear equations with fractions or decimals
- multiply both sides of the equation by the LCD of all fractions to isolate the variable (which is the LCM of all denominators) (must be done after simplification) 
#### Least common multiple 
- the smallest number that two or more numbers can divide into evenly
#### Least common denominator
- the smallest number that can be a common denominator for a set of fractions

### Linear equations with no solution or an infinite number of solutions
#### Conditional equation
- an equation that is true for some values as the variable & false for other values
#### Identity equation
- an equation which is always true, no matter what values are substituted as the variable
- usually in this type of equations one side is a simplified version of the other side
#### Contradiction equation
- an equation which doesn't have a solution

### Proportions
- claim that two ratios are equal
#### Cross multiplication property
- states that the product of the numerator of a fraction on one side of an equation & the denominator of the fraction on the other side should equal the product of the denominator of the same side & the numerator of the other side; for example if `a / b == c / d` then `ad == bc`
#### Solving proportion equations
- since in a equation like `a / b = c / d` the LCD of the fractions is 'bd', the shortcut to isolate the variable can be cross multiplication of fractions in both sides

### Solving linear algebra inequalities 1
- the procedure is the same as solving linear equations with key differences
    - when using multiplication property, negative operand causes the inequality to get reversed
#### Interval notation
- a way of writing subsets of the real number line
- interval notations can be used to annotate a range of numbers
    - parentheses mean the end isn't included in the range
    - brackets mean the end is included in the range
    - infinity can never be included

### Linear equations in two variables
- the overall form is `ax + by = c`
- 'c' is constant, 'a' & 'b' can't be zero at the same time
- this type of equation can have infinite combinations of 'x' & 'y' as it's solution
#### Ordered pair
- two terms inside parentheses with 'x' being the first & 'y' being the second
#### Solving linear equations in two variables
1. pick a value for one of the variables
2. solve for the other one
3. put the solution in the form of an ordered pair

### Plotting ordered pairs
#### Cartesian coordinate system
- has a horizontal number line as 'x' axis & a vertical number line as 'y' axis
- the intersection is called the origin where axes have the value of 0
- it is divided into quadras by counting counter clockwise from the top right quadra
- value signs of ordered pairs for each quadra are respectively like (+, +), (-, +), (-, -), (+, -)

### Graphing linear equations in two variables
- each point in the graph represents one of the infinite solutions of the equation
#### Intercepts
- the intersection between the graph and 'y' axis is called y-intercept
- the intersection between the graph and 'y' axis is called x-intercept
#### Steps
- two ordered pairs are needed, solving for intercepts is usually faster
- the graph can then be drawn between & after two points (implied by the ordered pairs)
- a third ordered pair is needed to check the graph & the equation
#### Origin crossing graph
- if the value of 'c' is 0, solving for intercepts results in (0, 0)
    1. 'x' & 'y' must be isolated
    2. the resulted equation is solved to get an ordered pair
- picking the coefficient of a variable for as the other is usually faster
#### special case scenarios
- vertical line
    - has a fixed value for 'x'
    - is parallel to 'y' axis
    - the equation in this scenario has 'b' as zero
- horizontal line
    - has a fixed value for 'y'
    - is parallel to 'x' axis
    - the equation in this scenario has 'a' as zero
